Plan ₿'s mission is to provide top-tier educational resources on Bitcoin in as many languages as possible. All content published on the site is open-source and hosted on GitHub, allowing anyone to participate in enriching the platform.

## Adding a Podcast

Are you looking to add a Bitcoin podcast to the Plan ₿ Network site and increase visibility for your show, but don't know how? This tutorial is for you!

- First, you need to have a GitHub account. If you don't know how to create one, we have made a detailed tutorial to guide you.

https://planb.network/tutorials/others/contribution/create-github-account-a75fc39d-f0d0-44dc-9cd5-cd94aee0c07c


- Go to [the GitHub repository of Plan ₿ dedicated to data](https://github.com/PlanB-Network/bitcoin-educational-content/tree/dev/resources/podcasts) in the `resources/podcasts/` section:
![image](assets/en/02.webp)
- Click on the top right on the `Add file` button, then on `Create new file`:
![image](assets/03.webp)
- If you have never contributed to the content of PlanB Network before, you will need to create your fork of the original repository. Forking a repository means creating a copy of that repository on your own GitHub account, allowing you to work on the project without affecting the original repository. Click on the `Fork this repository` button:
![image](assets/04.webp)
- You will then arrive at the GitHub editing page:
![image](assets/05.webp)
- Create a folder for your podcast. To do this, in the `Name your file...` box, write the name of your podcast in lowercase with dashes instead of spaces. For example, if your show is called "Super Podcast Bitcoin", you should write `super-podcast-bitcoin`:
![image](assets/06.webp)
- To validate the creation of the folder, simply add a slash after your podcast name in the same box, for example: `super-podcast-bitcoin/`. Adding a slash automatically creates a folder rather than a file:
![image](assets/07.webp)
- In this folder, you will create a first YAML file named `podcast.yml`:
![image](assets/08.webp)
- Fill in this file with information about your podcast using this template:

```yaml
id:
name:
host:
language:
links:
  podcast:
  twitter:
  website:
description: |

tags:
  -
  -
contributors:
  -
```

Here are the details to fill in for each field:

- **id**: A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to uniquely identify the tutorial. You can generate it with an online tool. The only constraint is that this UUID must be random, so as not to conflict with another UUID on the platform;
- **`name`**: Indicate the name of your podcast;
- **`host`**: List the names or pseudonyms of the speakers or the host of the podcast. Each name should be separated by a comma;
- **`language`**: Indicate the language code of the language spoken in your podcast. For example, for English, note `en`, for Italian `it`...

- **`links`**: Provide links to your content. You have two options:
	- `podcast`: the link to your podcast,
	- `twitter`: the link to the Twitter profile of the podcast or the organization producing it,
	- `website`: the link to the website of the podcast or the organization producing it.

- **`description`**: Add a short paragraph that describes your podcast. The description must be in the same language as indicated in the `language:` field.

- **`tags`**: Add two tags associated with your podcast. Examples:
    - `bitcoin`
    - `technology`
    - `economy`
    - `education`...

- **`contributors`**: Mention your contributor ID if you have one.

For example, your YAML file could look like this:

```yaml
id: 723f1d84-8713-4666-9f2e-bc936f26a1ee
name: Super Podcast Bitcoin
host: Rogzy, JohnOnChain, Lounes, Fanis, Ajlex, Guillaume, Pantamis, Sosthene, Loic

![image](assets/16.webp)

![image](assets/18.webp)
- In your podcast folder, click on the `Add file` button, then on `Create new file`:
![image](assets/19.webp)
- Name this new folder `assets` and confirm its creation by adding a slash `/` at the end:
![image](assets/20.webp)

# Adding More Resource Types

Podcasts are just the beginning! You have the opportunity to participate in producing other types of resources, which are very similar in structure with a few differences. Let's dive right into those!

You may want to have quick overall look before choosing the one you would like the most:
- **Channels**: YouTube channels about bitcoin, directly or indirectly related
- **Newsletters**: Collection of content that you can use for your educational projects
- **Movies and documentaries**: Discover captivating stories and in-depth explorations of Bitcoin evolution and impact

In the following sections, the different file structures for each of the aforementioned resource types will be presented, so that you can create new resources following the same guidelines as for podcasts.

## Add Channels

```yaml

  A key initiative from the Bitcoin Operations Technology Group (Optech) that bridges the gap between Bitcoin businesses and open source technology. The newsletter, released weekly, focuses on helping Bitcoin companies implement the most efficient and cost-effective operational practices. A primary focus is optimizing transaction sizes and managing fee costs through better technical implementation. The content covers technical developments, practical workshops, original research, and real-world case studies. What makes this newsletter particularly valuable is its non-profit nature (funded by member companies and seed investors Wences Casares and John Pfeffer) and its commitment to open source - all materials are released under the MIT license. It's especially relevant for engineers and managers at Bitcoin companies who want to stay current with the latest operational best practices and strengthen their connection to the open source community.

  Bitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It traces the history of money from the
  bartering societies of the ancient world to the trading floors of Wall St. The
  documentary exposes the practices of central banks and the dubious financial
  actors who brought the world to its knees in the last crisis. It highlights the
  Government influence on the money creation process and how it causes inflation.
  Moreover, this film explains how most money we use today is created out of thin
  air by banks when they create debt. Epic in scope, this film examines the
  patterns of technological innovation and questions everything you thought you
  knew about money. Is Bitcoin an alternative to national currencies backed by
  debt? Will Bitcoin and cryptocurrency spark a revolution in how we use money
  peer to peer? Is it a gift to criminals? Or is it the next bubble waiting to
  burst? If you trust in your money just as it is - this film has news for you.
